# Python-Machine Learning-
This is to create and store all the ML algorithm and feature engineering codes
Also to do so we might need various libraries such as pandas, nupy, sklearn to compute, predict, visualize and so on.
Below are installation commands of common libraries used most during the building the ML model.
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages.

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

```bash
pip install pandas
```

```bash
pip install numpy
```

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#reads the given csv file
csvData = pd.read_csv("xyz.csv")

#generates an array of given parameters 
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)



```
